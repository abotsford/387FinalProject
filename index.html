        <p>This website will cover three areas of interest in Australia: mining operations relationship to water, mining operations <br> relationship to rail, and historic mines' relationship to both rail and water.</p>

            <p>  Based on the data vizualized to the right, you can see both the data points of all operating mines as well as operating mines within 5 miles of a water source. In blue, are the water sources.**Note: The water sources vizualized here are only those within 75 miles of all operating mines. This was to save processing times and was done under the assumption thay mines would not be using water sources that are more than 73 miles away** As noted by the yelllow points, 1,259 of the 4,451 operating mines (or 28%)  are those within 5 miles of a water source. This distinction is important to note as depending on what is being mined, water sources can be contaminated by the mining processes. All of the mining points can be clicked on to learn more about that mine (e.g., the name of the mine and what is being mined there). </p>

            <p>Since the industrial revolution, rail has been an integral component in the movement of raw minerals and ores from mines around the world. Australia is among the top five producers with $160 billion in mining exports including the more important commodities such as bauxite, uranium, iron ore, coal, copper, zinc, gold, silver, and diamonds (Commonwealth of Australia, 2013). The map to the right shows all of the operating mines in Australia in relation to established rail lines. The blue indicators represent the 43.6% of operating mines located within five miles of a rail line. The majority of these mines are near to seaports providing for more efficient export.</p>
